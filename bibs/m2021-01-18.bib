For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA-sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering, and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a dataset is often unknown, and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution, we present clustering trees. This visualization shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions, allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset. Clustering trees can be produced using the clustree R package, available from CRAN and developed on GitHub.}",

  ABSTRACT={Currently most methods take manual strategies to annotate cell types after clustering the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Such methods are labor-intensive and heavily rely on user expertise, which may lead to inconsistent results. We present SCSA, an automatic tool to annotate cell types from scRNA-seq data, based on a score annotation model combining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and confidence levels of cell markers from both known and user-defined information. Evaluation on real scRNA-seq datasets from different sources with other methods shows that SCSA is able to assign the cells into the correct types at a fully automated mode with a desirable precision.}

Nevertheless, because of artifacts introduced during library preparation and sequencing, the detection of low-frequency variants at high specificity is problematic. Here, we present Espresso, an error suppression method that considers local sequence features to accurately detect single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). Compared to other advanced error suppression techniques, Espresso consistently demonstrated lower numbers of false-positive mutation calls and greater sensitivity. We demonstrated Espresso{\textquoteright}s superior performance in detecting MRD in the peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) throughout their treatment course. Furthermore, we showed that accurate mutation calling in a small number of informative genomic loci might provide a cost-efficient strategy for pragmatic risk prediction of AML development in healthy individuals. More broadly, we aim for Espresso to aid with accurate mutation detection in many other research and clinical settings.},

    abstract = "{Biological pathways reflect the key cellular mechanisms that dictate disease states, drug response and altered cellular function. The local areas of pathways are defined as subpathways (SPs), whose dysfunction has been reported to be associated with the occurrence and development of cancer. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, identifying dysfunctional SPs by using multi-omics data has become possible. Moreover, the SPs are not isolated in the biological system but interact with each other. Here, we propose a network-based calculated method, CNA2Subpathway, to identify dysfunctional SPs is driven by somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in cancer through integrating pathway topology information, multi-omics data and SP crosstalk. This provides a novel way of SP analysis by using the SP interactions in the system biological level. Using data sets from breast cancer and head and neck cancer, we validate the effectiveness of CNA2Subpathway in identifying cancer-relevant SPs driven by the somatic CNAs, which are also shown to be associated with cancer immune and prognosis of patients. We further compare our results with five pathway or SP analysis methods based on CNA and gene expression data without considering SP crosstalk. With these analyses, we show that CNA2Subpathway could help to uncover dysfunctional SPs underlying cancer via the use of SP crosstalk. CNA2Subpathway is developed as an R-based tool, which is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/hanjunwei-lab/CNA2Subpathway).}",

These approaches do not incorporate population information directly into the process of variant calling, and are often limited to filtering which trades recall for precision. In this study, we modify DeepVariant to add a new channel encoding population allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project. We show that this model reduces variant calling errors, improving both precision and recall. We assess the impact of using population-specific or diverse reference panels. We achieve the greatest accuracy with diverse panels, suggesting that large, diverse panels are preferable to individual populations, even when the population matches sample ancestry. Finally, we show that this benefit generalizes to samples with different ancestry from the training data even when the ancestry is also excluded from the reference panel.Competing Interest StatementAK, SG, TY, PC and AC are employees of Google LLC and own Alphabet stock as part of the standard compensation package.

    abstract = {Author summary Researchers often validate scientific hypotheses by comparing data with the predictions of a mathematical or computational model. This comparison can be quantified by the âlog-likelihoodâ, a number that captures how well the model explains the data. However, for complex models common in neuroscience and computational biology, obtaining exact formulas for the log-likelihood can be difficult. Instead, the log-likelihood is usually approximated by simulating synthetic observations from the model (âsamplingâ), and seeing how often the simulated data match the actual observations. To reach correct scientific conclusions, it is crucial that the log-likelihood estimates produced by such sampling methods are accurate (unbiased). Here, we introduce inverse binomial sampling (IBS), a method which differs from traditional approaches in that the number of samples drawn from the model is not fixed, but adaptively adjusted in a simple way. For each data point, IBS samples from the model until it matches the observation. We show that IBS is unbiased and has other desirable statistical properties, both theoretically and via empirical validation on three case studies from computational and cognitive neuroscience. Across all examples, IBS outperforms fixed sampling methods, demonstrating the utility of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement method for log-likelihood evaluation.},
